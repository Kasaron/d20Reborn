1 square (or hex) is 1 meter.
1 round is approximately 1 second of in game time.
During a round, all actions are considered to be simultaneous, except where such actions conflict (See Conflicted Actions)
It is not necessary (or advisable) to keep track of rounds when not explicitly necessary for determining order and timing of actions.
