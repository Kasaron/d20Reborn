In the case of two or more actions which are contradictory or in conflict, order is determined by opposed Reflex Rolls.
The best way to handle order of conflicted actions is to have the players declare their actions in order from lowest roll to highest, then resolve the actions from highest to lowest.
If an action can no longer occur because of the result of a conflicted action Roll, the action continues, and automatically fails.
For example, if a creature attempts to hit a target, but the target moves out of the way, the attack action still happens, but the creature automatically misses.
For actions which cannot necessarily or logically fail, the action continues until it cannot, then stops.
For example, if two creatures attempt to occupy the same space, the failed opposed roll would result in the creature stopping next to the square it intended to end in.
