Actions often have a cool-down period, which represents a creature needing time to ready the action again.
This Interval is noted as #s, where # is the number of Rounds the action is unavailable for, starting the Round after the action is completed.
In the case of failed actions, the Interval still occurs, but begins the Round after the action fails.
