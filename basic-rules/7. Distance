Most actions have a distance which they are effective at.
Distance is separated into Ranged and Melee distances.
Distance is always noted in squares.
Ranged distance is more free-form; often without a set limit.
Ranged distance is always noted with the maximum distance first, followed by the minimum distance; #-#.
The maximum Ranged distance is the furthest the action can be taken, without penalty.
The maximum Ranged distance is also the interval at which penalty is accrued.
The minimum Ranged distance is the nearest the action can be taken, without penalty.
Ranged actions beyond the maximum distance receive a -1[Competence], this Penalty doubles for every maximum Ranged distance between the target and the creature.
Ranged actions within the minimum distance receive a -4[Competence].
Ranged attacks receive this Penalty on both Attack and Threat.
Melee distance is a strict range which the action can act in. 
Melee distance is always noted in parenthesis, with the maximum distance first, followed by the minimum distance; (#-#)
The maximum Melee distance is the furthest an action can be taken.
The minimum Melee distance is the nearest the action can be taken.
