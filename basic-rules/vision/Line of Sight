Concealment is a partial impediment to Line of Sight.
Concealment provides a bonus to Defense, based upon how much of the target is obscured.
Light Cover is when approximately 25% of the target's vital areas are obscured.
Medium Cover is when approximately 50% of the target's vital areas are obscured.
Full Cover is when approximately 75% of the target's vital areas are obscured.
Obscured is when the target is completely obscured by an object.
