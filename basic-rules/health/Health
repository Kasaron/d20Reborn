If a creature receives Wounds equal to their Health as the result of a single Threat, the creature makes a Fortitude Save against the amount they failed the Threat DC by.
If the creature Fails the Fortitude Save, they are immediately killed.
Healing
A creature may attempt to heal Wounds by resting, by not perform any strenuous actions (DC=14+Relevant Attribute) for 24 hours.
For every 24 hours of rest, a creature may make a Fortitude Save (DC=14+Wounds).
If the Fortitude Save Succeeds, the creature loses 1 Wound.
