All Mana-dependent actions have a Mana DC.
To take an action which requires Mana, a creature makes a Mana Roll (=1d20+Mana Pool), versus the Mana DC.
If the Roll succeeds, the action succeeds, and the creature loses 1 point from their Mana Pool.
If the Roll has at least 1 Success Step, the creature does not lose any points from their Mana Pool.
If the Roll fails, the action fails, and the creature loses 1 point from their Mana Pool.
For every Failure Step, the creature loses an additional point of Mana.
If a creature has no Mana in their Mana Pool, they cannot use Mana-dependent actions.
