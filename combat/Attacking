Attacks are any action which must physically touch a target to be effective, and require a level of precision or control.
To Attack, make an Attack Roll against the tagret's Passive Defense Score.
If the Attack Roll succeeds, the target has been hit.
If the Attack Roll fails, the Attack has missed.
If the Attack fails, the Attack action still occurs, but the efect is not applied to the target.
